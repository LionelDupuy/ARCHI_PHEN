These scripts require gphoto2 (http://www.gphoto.org/).

The soundtrigger script requires Perl and the following modules:
	Audio::DSP
	Term::ReadKey
	Time::HiRes

USAGE

Put the scripts on your path or run them from the current folder.
Image files are downloaded and put in the current directory.

1. Connect your camera to the computer using a USB cable.
2. Run tether.
3. Take a picture.

It may take a second or two for photos to be downloaded depending
on the speed of your USB connection and camera.


TROUBLESHOOTING

If photos are not being automatically displayed when using tether
but everything else seems to be working then you may not have the
Eye of Gnome (eog) image display program. You can either install it
or change the view script to use a different image viewer.


Test if gphoto recognizes your camera by typing

	gphoto2 --auto-detect


It's possible you may need to tweak the value of CAMERA_FOLDER
in tether or soundtrigger. You can find the correct folder for
your camera by typing

	gphoto2 --list-folders
